## ðŸ‘¾ Instroduction
Automated scoring of Chinese narrative essays is crucial in the field of education. Existing evaluation benchmarks for Chinese narrative essays face three limitations: \textbf{\textit{(a)}} Existing benchmarks focus more on English essays, and there is a relative lack of benchmarks for Chinese narrative essays, \textbf{\textit{(b)}} There is an absence of effective feedback tailored to essays, and \textbf{\textit{(c)}} There is no comprehensive evaluation framework for Chinese narrative essays using large language models (LLMs). These issues affect educators' acceptance of LLMs-based assessment for Chinese narrative essay writing. To bridge this gap, we introduce ElionBench. This is a multi-trait, feedback-oriented, and cross-prompt scenario benchmark for Chinese narrative essays. The benchmark contains 16,813 narrative essays from students in grades 3-9, covering 56 writing prompts. To reliably evaluate the performance of LLMs on Chinese narrative essays, ElionBench conducts a comprehensive assessment from three aspects: \textbf{\textit{(1) Foundational Ability:}} evaluating the performance of LLMs in terms of total score and multi-traits; \textbf{\textit{(2) Feedback Effectiveness:}} assessing the degree of alignment between LLMs-generated feedback and reference feedback. and \textbf{\textit{(3) Cross-prompt Ability:}} examining the adaptability and robustness of LLMs in cross-prompt scenarios. Finally, we benchmark 16 popular LLMs, revealing that their performance exhibits gaps compared to human evaluations and pretrained language models. Through ElionBench, we comprehensively assess LLM performance on Chinese narrative essay tasks, thus facilitating LLM progress in Chinese essay data analysis domains.
